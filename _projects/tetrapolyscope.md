### Overview

[TetraPolyscope](https://github.com/i-geng/polyscope-py) is a fork of Nicholas Sharpe's 
great library [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/py/). Our version was developed 
to rasterize tetrachromatic graphics for Professor Ng's lab at UC Berkeley.

Based on Jessica Lee's work on the [Theory of Tetrachromacy](https://imjal.github.io/theory-of-tetrachromacy/), our goal for the TetraPolyscope library is to provide
functionality for rasterizing 4-channel image and video assets.

TetraPolyscope has been used in the development of a prototype tetrachromatic DLP projector
that has 6 primary LED lights, in collaboration with Benjamin Smith and Professor Will
Tuten's lab at UC Berkeley.
