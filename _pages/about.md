Hello, I'm Irene! I'm a first year Master's student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science, with a focus
in Graphics/Visual Computing and Systems.

My dream is to work on graphics software for artists! I'm constantly inspired by my amazing artist brother, who
is studying Character Animation over at CalArts, as well as so many 2D and 3D animated shows and films. I want to get
as close as I can to the creation and development of the stories that I love so much.

Current interests: procedural shading for non-photorealistic rendering & the physics of realistic
mesh deformation!
