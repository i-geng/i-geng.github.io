Hello, I'm Irene! I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science and data science. Since May 2023, I've also been an intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, working on flight software for the Mars Sample Retrieval Lander.

Currently, I'm most interested in computer graphics--some of my favorite graphics projects are here on this website--and operating systems, and I'm also excited to be studying computational photography/computer vision, reinforcement learning, and compilers this fall.

Besides academics, I love being involved in multiple dance clubs on campus and having cooking socials with friends.
